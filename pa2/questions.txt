ANSWERED ON WEDNESDAY 20/10/2021:

1. std::list -> implemented as a doubly-linked list? 
   Where are the actual properties of this list i.e. head Node, ptr 2 head Node? 
   How/where do I interact with these things e.g. to push, pop? There's no constructor
   What is the relationship b/w (a) Stack/Queue and the interface OrderingStructure?

   A: List built-in fns. Will constrain implementation.

2. How can we test/determine runtime? Just on paper or?

A: Depends on list built-ins. Don't worry tooooo much.

3. Forgot to submit partner's CWL in partners.txt. I have it now: lciappi

Email Kate.

4. Weight on tests that I write myself? Don't worry

5. Stack tests
   Existing: appear to test that push and pop work
   Add:
      - tests for OrderingStructure::add() & OrderingStructure::remove()? Just test push
      - peek w/o removing
         - optional: peek -> pop -> peek
      - isEmpty
      - edge cases - remove/peek w/ nothing in it. Covered by specification of fns. 
   Given that it's parametrized type, we can assume that if it works with type A it'll work w/ types B-Z? 
      No need to test explicitly for this?
