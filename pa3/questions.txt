Friday 19/11:
1. stats.cpp comment about what stats::stats(PNG & im) is meant to do. 
'for each color channel, (x, y) is the cumulative sum of the color values from (0, 0) to (x, y)'
'color channel' = hX/hY/s/l? *Y*

- HSLAPixel.h. line 17: "h is in range [0, 360)", i.e. can be any value from 0 to 359, inclusive. NOT 360.
    but stats.h says h can be 360? *If it's â‰¥ 360, wrap around so subtract 360. As a guard - not an assumption*

2. Error re: entropy on make?. *Resolved see that line.*

3. How to test? I tried make => ./testComp . "No such file or directory." *solved*

4. TEST_CASE "stats::basic stats" => declaring a PNG. Size? Data.resize(1, 1) valid? *solved*
5. How to make this PNG red? Is this even necessary to test stats? *solved see above*

6. testComp.cpp, line 30 "stats s(data)". What does this do -- initializes "stats" obj based on the provided img?
    Name = "s"? *Y*
    Type = "stats"? *Y*

7. Weird typing stuff while writing first test 
    lines 21-24 *fine*
    lines 28, 32 - vec of vec contains doubles, how to make sure that I'm comparing it against a double?
        *will tell you if it fails in that specific way (" 0 != 0.0000000000001")*

8. For getting PNGs generated during tests to be displayed visually? - *PA2 generates + saves imgs, can check their tests for syntax*
